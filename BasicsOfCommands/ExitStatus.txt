Each linux command return a status(integer 0-255) when it's executed.
We can capture this return status using " $? "
if $? value is 0 ,then we can say that the executed command was succeded else failed.
We can also store this exit status of a command in a variable also
    Ex: cmdStatus=$? or cmdStatus=${?}
